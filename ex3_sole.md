Can you have more than one Submit button? If you do, how does the server tell which one was clicked? (Hint: experiment with the attribtues of the <submit> tag.)

answerï¼š
    1. EMAIL=fdfd&password=fdfd&secret_info=secret_value&login=Log+In%21
    2. EMAIL=&password=&secret_info=secret_value&login=Log+In_3%21EMAIL=fdfd&password=fdfd&secret_info=secret_value&login=Log+In%21

    the {login: Login+In} is different from {login: Log+In_3}

    <input type="submit" name="login" value="Log In_2!">
    <input type="submit" name="login" value="Log In_3!">

Can the form be submitted using GET instead of POST? If yes, what is the difference in how the server sees those requests?

answer: 
    yes;
    lack request body;
 

What other HTTP verbs are possible in the form submit route? Can you get the web browser to generate a route that uses PUT, PATCH, or DELETE?

answer:
